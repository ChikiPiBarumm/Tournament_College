To run the program you need to extract archive to an empty folder. For some reason in "software.exe" file some systems indicates a virus, so if this file don`t run
use file "software_opt.py" and open in from PythonIDLE and you should be good to go!

IMPORTANT: You should keep "software file" and "Extras folder" in ONE(SAME) FOLDER

P.S. If you want to fully recreate database, you need to delete "tournament_managment.db" from "Extras folder" and run "db_creation.py"
